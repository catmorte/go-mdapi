# go-mdapi (currently in beta)

## intention

go-mdapi is yet another cli client based on markdown declaration. Original idea is to use it togeather with nvim (to have syntax highlight).
At the moment supports built-in http client (aka simple http requests) + ability to extend the api via go templates: [samples](/samples/)
